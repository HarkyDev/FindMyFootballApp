## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
The idea of this project was a fairly simple one from a users point of view. The concept was to simply have a user be able to see their football(soccer) team of choice from the world top competitive leagues in the world and see some relative information about their team but most importantly, as the name suggests find the geographical and physical location of where the teams stadium is located. As we all know its no good knowing you're going to go see a team on bright saturday morning just to not know where the stadium is. The user should be presented after making their choice of team with said information and a map that shows a marker of where the stadium could be found on a map that is rendered on the page as well. 

## THINGS TO IMPROVE ON 
- zoom in and out buttons
- better api to avoid cors errors
- possibly store more info locally
- would have added more leagues if the api could handle it without erroring on our free plan
- possibly add more information about team on the bottom section
